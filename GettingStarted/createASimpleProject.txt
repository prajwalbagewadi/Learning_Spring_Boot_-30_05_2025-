Creating A Spring Boot Project:
    1.
        First Go To: ("https://start.spring.io")
            you can select your options and Generate a new Spring Boot Project
                Build_tool: Gradle-Groovy, Gradle-Kotlin, Maven(selected)
                Language: Java(selected), Kotlin, Groovy
                SpringBoot:3.4.2(snapshot), 3.4.1(selected/StableVersion), 3.3.8(snapshot), 3.3.7
                Project_MetaData:
                    Group(Org that owns the Project):com.codewithmosh(default is reverseDomainName)
                    Artifact(Name of the Project):demo(build a online Store.)
                    Name(Changes as per Artifact):demo
                    Description:Demo Project for SpringBoot
                    Package_name(combination of Group and Artifact):com.codewithmosh.demo
                    Packaging(package type): Jar(selected), War
                    Java(Java version):23(selected), 21, 17

                Dependencies(thirdparty libraires or frameworks that will be used in the Project):

                Click(Generate)

                Gives you a Zip file(unpack it) and this can be opened in your favouriate Editior.

    2.
        Create a SpringBoot Project Directly inside Intellji
            (Requires Intellji Ultimate edition which is paid so.)
            the method is completely similar to start.spring.io method except a few 
            more Customizations.
    
    3. 
        Lets Try the Eclipse IDE And Set it up
            To create a Spring Boot project in Eclipse, follow these steps:
            âœ… Prerequisites:
                Eclipse IDE (preferably Eclipse IDE for Enterprise Java Developers)
                Java JDK 17+ installed
                Spring Tools (STS) plugin for Eclipse (optional but recommended)

            ðŸ”§ Step-by-Step Guide:
                ðŸ”¹ Option 1: Using Spring Starter Project (Recommended)
                        Open Eclipse
                        Launch Eclipse and switch to the Java EE or Java Perspective.
                        Install Spring Tools (If not already installed)
                        
                        Go to:
                        Help â†’ Eclipse Marketplace â†’ Search "Spring Tools" â†’ Install "Spring Tools 4 (aka Spring Tool Suite 4)"
                        Create a New Spring Starter Project

                        Go to:
                            File â†’ New â†’ Spring Starter Project
                        If not visible, try:
                            File â†’ New â†’ Other â†’ Spring â†’ Spring Starter Project

                        Project Metadata Configuration
                            Fill in:
                            Name: e.g., demo-app
                            Type: Maven
                            Packaging: Jar
                            Java Version: 17 (or as per your JDK)
                            Group: com.example
                            Artifact: demo
                            Choose Dependencies
                                Example:
                                    Spring Web
                                    Spring Boot DevTools
                                    Spring Data JPA (if DB needed)
                                    H2/MySQL Driver (if using DB)
                                Finish
                                    Click Finish, and Eclipse will create the project and download dependencies.
